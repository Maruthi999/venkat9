### Introduction

Asuswrt comes with built-in support for numerous tunnelling methods that allows you to get IPv6 support through your IPv4-only ISP.   You can use a 6in4 tunnel provided by Hurricane Electric.


### Hurricane Electric (AKA TunnelBroker) service

Signing up for a tunnel with them is free, and simple.  They will provide you with a routed /64 block (meaning you get your own static, fully routed, block of 2^64 IPs).  You can also request a larger block if needed (for example if you want to do some additional subnetting).

Setting up the router is fairly simple.  On the IPv6 section simply select the 6in4 option, and fill up the informations provided by HE:

* IPv4 remote Endpoint = Server IPv4 Address on TunnelBroker
* IPv6 client IP = Client IPv6 Address (without the /64 at the end - that is entered below)
* IPv6 Prefix Lenght will be 64
* IPv6 Prefix = Routed /64: (without the /64 at the end)
* Prefix Length will be 64
* IPv6 DNS Server 1 is optional (if your ISP's DNS support IPv6 resolution), otherwise enter the Anycasted IPv6 Caching Nameserver

**Router Settings page**  =  **HE  Sites setting page**
* Server IPv4 Address =  Use Server IPv4 Address: on Tunnel Details IPv6 Tunnel Tab
* Client IPv6 Address =  Use Client IPv6 Address: on Tunnel Details IPv6 Tunnel Tab
* IPv6 Prefix Length  =  Use 64
* Server IPv6 Address =  Use Server IPv6 Address: on Tunnel Details IPv6 Tunnel Tab
* Tunnel MTU 	      =  Use MTU  on Tunnel Details Advanced tab 
* Tunnel TTL 	      =  Router defaults are fine
* LAN Prefix Length   =  Use 48
* LAN IPv6 Prefix     =  Routed /48: hit button to  get your prefix xxxx:xxx:xxxx:: 


Also make sure to enable Router Advertisement.  This is what will automatically assign IPv6 addresses to your devices on your LAN, and provide them with routing information (a bit similar to what DHCP does for IPv4, but more advanced).

The next step: you need to somehow tell Hurricane Electric what your current IPv4 is.  There are two methods.

1) You can use the TunnelBroker option on the DDNS tab make account with Trial button in router. Just like a regular Dynamic DNS service, this will take care of letting HE know about any IP change.

Setup
* Host name                   = Use Tunnel ID : "xxxxxx" on Tunnel Details IPv6 Tunnel Tab
* User Name or E-mail Address = Use User ID "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx" on Main page of HE upon login
* Password or DDNS Key        = Use Update Key on Tunnel Details Advanced tab 


2) If you want to use DDNS for a regular DDNS service, you can replace the functionality using a custom script.


### Configuring a tunnel endpoint update script

For the second method, you will need to enable the [JFFS](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki/JFFS) partition and custom configs and scripts.  Once that's done, create a `/jffs/scripts/wan-start` [user script](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki/User-scripts) that will take care of updating HE with your current WAN IP.  Here is an example script:

NOTE: If your tunnel was made before 19th Jan 2014, you need to uncomment the second wget line in the script, and comment the first. That's because old tunnels need your md5'd password, and newer ones need the tunnel update key.

```

    echo "" >> "$STARTUP_SCRIPT_LOG_FILE"
    echo "Already Connected - $( date )" >> "$STARTUP_SCRIPT_LOG_FILE"

#if ping test failed, pause until connection is ready.

    i=0
    while [ $i -le 50 ]
    do

        then
            echo "" >> "$STARTUP_SCRIPT_LOG_FILE"
            echo "Now Connected, starting tunnel update - $( date )" >> "$STARTUP_SCRIPT_LOG_FILE"
            break
        fi
        echo >> "$STARTUP_SCRIPT_LOG_FILE"
        echo "Not Connected, - $( date )" >> "$STARTUP_SCRIPT_LOG_FILE"
        echo "connecting wait ..."

        sleep 15

    done

cat /tmp/wget.tmp.$etime >> $STARTUP_SCRIPT_LOG_FILE
echo "" >> $STARTUP_SCRIPT_LOG_FILE
rm /tmp/wget.tmp.$etime
```

and don't forget to make it executable:
```
chmod +x /jffs/scripts/wan-start
```
Edit the parameters at the top to enter your UserID (it's an hexadecimal value, found on the Main Page of your account info in Tunnel Broker - right after you log in), password (or update key for newer tunnels), and tunnelID (found on the page where you see all the details of your tunnel).

You can manually execute the script, then check the content of /tmp/ipv6.log to ensure that the script is running correctly.

After that, you can test your tunnel by accessing, for example, http://www.whatismyipv6.com.  If you see an IPv6 (meaning a long hexadecimal string), then congratulations - you're set!


### Security

Starting with Asuswrt-Merlin 3.0.0.4.374.32, a user-configurable IPv6 firewall is available (and is enabled by default).  Be aware however that previous versions, as well as the original firmware from Asus provide NO firewalling on the IPv6 interfaces, leaving your whole LAN open for access from the Internet over IPv6 addresses.


### Conclusion

That pretty much covers it.  Tunnels are a great way for you to familiarize yourself with IPv6, regardless of what your ISP provides you.
