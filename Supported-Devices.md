While Asuswrt can support many devices (and the list is growing), the list of routers that will be supported in Asuswrt-merlin will be far more limited, as I lack the time to support all of them.  My focus will be on the Broadcom-based devices, more specifically the higher-end devices (with at least 32 MB of flash).

The following devices are fully supported:

* RT-N66U
* RT-AC56U
* RT-AC66U
* RT-AC68U (including revision C1)
* RT-AC68P
* RT-AC87U
* RT-AC3200
* RT-AC88U
* RT-AC3100
* RT-AC5300

Note that the R (retail SKU) and W (white casing SKU) are also all supported, as they are the same exact hardware and firmware.

These devices are no longer officially supported:

* RT-N16
