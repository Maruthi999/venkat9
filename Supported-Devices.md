While Asuswrt can support many devices (and the list is growing), the list of routers I will support in Asuswrt-merlin will be far more limited, as I lack the time to support all of them, and also because it's very difficult to support a router I don't own.  It means I can't even confirm that it will flash properly.

The following devices are fully supported:
* RT-N66U
* RT-AC66U

The following devices are partially supported, as experimental:
* RT-N16

I decided to support the RT-16 despite not owning one because it was very close to the RT-N66U, and there was a good amount of requests for it.  However it means that it is more likely to display issues, and might not be updated as often as the supported routers.

If a skilled developer owning a non-supported device is interested in helping officially support it, please let me know.
