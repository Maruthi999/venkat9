Asuswrt-Merlin is available in two separate branches:

- The original Asuswrt-Merlin (up to version 380.xxx)
- The new branch (version 382.xxx and newer)

Each branch supports different models.  As Asus upgrades models to the new 382 code base, they will gradually be migrated to Asuswrt-Merlin's 382 branch, with the exception of the RT-N66U and RT-AC66U which will remain on the legacy 380 branch.


Supported devices on version 380:
 * RT-N66U
 * RT-AC66U
 * RT-AC66U_B1 (use the RT-AC68U firmware)
 * RT-AC56U
 * RT-AC68U, RT-AC68P, RT-AC68UF (including HW revision C1 and E1)

NOTE: all the "R" versions (for example RT-N66R) are the same as their "U" counterparts, they are just different packages aimed at large retailers.
