While Asuswrt can support many devices (and the list is growing), the list of routers that will be supported in Asuswrt-merlin will be far more limited, as I lack the time to support all of them.  My focus will be on the Broadcom-based devices, more specifically the higher-end devices (with at least 32 MB of flash).

The following devices are fully supported:

* RT-N16
* RT-AC56U (and R)
* RT-N66U (and R)
* RT-AC66U (and R)
