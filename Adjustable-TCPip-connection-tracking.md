Under _Tools -> Other Settings_ there are various parameters that lets you tweak the timeout values related to connection tracking for TCP and UDP connections.  You should be careful with those settings - they rarely need to be changed, except when dealing with special scenarios that might need it.  Most commonly, people will tweak the UDP timeout values to make them more VoIP-friendly, by using smaller timeouts.  Timeout values are in 
seconds.
