This is the part where you usually put a lot of legalese stuff that nobody reads.  I'm not a lawyer, so I'll just make it simple, using my own words rather than some pre-crafted text that will bore you to death:

1. I take no responsibility for issues caused by this project.  I do my best to ensure that everything works fine.  If something goes wrong, my apologies.

2. Copyrights belong to the appropriate individuals/entities, under the appropriate licences.  GPL code is covered by GPL, proprietary code is (c)copyright their respective owners, yadda yadda.

3. I try my best to honor the licences (as far as I can understand them, as a normal human being).  Anything GPL or otherwise open-sourced that I modify will see my changes published to Github at some point.  A release might get delayed if I'm working using pre-release code.  If it's GPL, it will eventually be published - no need to send a horde of legal threats at me.

4. In any other cases not covered, Common Sense prevails,  and I shall also make use of Good Will.

And for those worried about privacy:

This firmware does not contact me back in any way whatsoever.  Not even through any update checker - the only update code there is Asus's.
