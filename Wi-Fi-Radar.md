Wi-Fi Radar is a feature available only on the RT-AC86U and RT-AX88U (and that can also be found on the GT-AC5300 on Asus's stock firmware) which uses Broadcom's visualization engine to provide advanced technical information about your wireless environment.  The tab can be found on the Wireless section of the router's web interface.

To use it, you must first go to the Settings page, and enable Data Collection on that page.  After that give it a few seconds, and information should become available on the various pages on the Wi-Fi Radar section.
