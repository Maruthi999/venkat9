Asuswrt-Merlin's OpenVPN interface tries to reproduce as closely as possible the interface used on the Tomato firmware (which shares the same OpenVPN code).  Look around for tutorials written for Tomato, those can easily be applied to this firmware as well.

One such tutorial that is recommended (for configuring the OpenVPN server) can be found [here](http://www.howtogeek.com/60774/connect-to-your-home-network-from-anywhere-with-openvpn-and-tomato/).
