Here is a minimalist script that uses ipset lists on the routers firewall to block scanners, bots, malware, ransomware, brute force crackers bogon IPs, hacked IPs, hostile spiders, etc, (much over 650 million unique sources) from the published tiers maintained by [Cybercrime IP Feeds by FireHOL](http://iplists.firehol.org/)

The script is located [**here**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shounak-de/misc-scripts/master/ya-malware-block.sh)

The snbforums thread to discuss the script is [**here**](https://www.snbforums.com/threads/yet-another-malware-block-script-using-ipset-v4-and-v6.38935/)

Features, installation instructions, scheduling, whitelisting and other information is detailed in the first post on that forum thread.
