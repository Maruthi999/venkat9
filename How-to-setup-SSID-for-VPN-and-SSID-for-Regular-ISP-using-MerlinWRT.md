"This setup that I made is just to simplify connecting to a VPN for wireless devices. A lot of people use VPN's to connect work and many use it to change there IP location to view geographically restricted content (Netflix, Hulu, etc) Simply put, you don't have to created specific rules for specific devices to route them over the VPN with this setup. You can just connect to the SSID that gets routed to the VPN and go. This is quite simple to implement in other custom firmwares (DD-WRT, Tomato) but I didn't want to go this route. These other firmwares, to the best of my knowledge, don't allow the use of hardware acceleration that is available in the RT-N66U. I wanted to keep this feature as I don't use QoS and other features that would disable it. Also, I have tried a couple of DD-WRT builds and found them to be "buggy" with this router. 

Also, before I used two separate routers for my network. One was for the VPN and one was for the ISP. This setup allows for you to only use one router. "- J0bongo
