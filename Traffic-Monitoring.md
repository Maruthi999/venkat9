You can use [wrtbwmon](http://code.google.com/p/wrtbwmon/) to monitor traffic usage by each of your network devices.  See this [howto](http://code.google.com/p/wrtbwmon/wiki/Deploying), and follow the instructions specific to Tomato (except use /www/user/usage.htm instead of /tmp/usage.htm).

Note that a future Asuswrt-Merlin release will include the IPTraffic system from Tomato, which will let you easily track your individual device's traffic.
