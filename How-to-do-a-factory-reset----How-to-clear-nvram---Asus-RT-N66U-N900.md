There are many ways to clear nvram / To do a factory reset on the Asus RT-N66U N900 Black Diamond (Original and Asuswrt-merlin Firmware):

* Turn the router on with the WPS button pressed
* Use the option to revert to factory defaults on the webui
* (ADVANCED USERS ONLY) do an mtd-erase -d nvram
* Boot to recovery mode, and use the webui at 192.168.1.1 to clear out nvram
