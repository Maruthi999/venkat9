Various configuration files are generated by the firmware for various built-in services.  Asuswrt-Merlin allows you to either append content to some of these configuration files, or even completely replace them with custom versions you have created. Those config override files must be stored in /jffs/configs/ (so you must first enable the [JFFS](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki/JFFS) partition).  To have a config file appended to the one created by the firmware, simply append ".add" at the end of the file listed below.  For example, /jffs/configs/dnsmasq.conf.add will be added at the 
end of the dnsmasq configuration file that is created by the firmware, while /jffs/configs/dnsmasq.conf would completely replace it.

Note that replacing a config file with your own implies that you properly fill in all the fields usually dynamically created by the firmware.  Since some of these entries require dynamic parameters, you might want to dynamically generatethe config file through an init-start script which could retrieve parameters from nvram, and insert them in your custom config.

The list of available config overrides:

* dnsmasq.conf
* vsftpd.conf
* pptpd.conf
* dhcp6s.conf
* hosts (for /etc/hosts)
* smb.conf
* minidlna.conf
* profile (shell profile, only profile.add supported)
* upnp (for miniupnpd)
* radvd.conf
